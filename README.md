# sugar-cosmetics-clone

Hello everyone,

I am  Deepak Kumar Singh, cloned the Sugar Cosmetic website as a part of Unit 3 Project . I would like to thank Masai for giving me this wonderful opportunity.

 I started my project (Sugar Cosmetic Clone) with a lot of excitement and enthusaism and divided my work in little part. I made planning for this project which is very useful for me as a result i am able to complete comfortably this project before time.As a part of my planning ,first of all i would like to make the navbar because it stays on almost every page and other pages are also embebded in it. For making navbar i uses the import and export functionality which makes my task easier.

I started by building the homepage and I tried to make it very close to the original website I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery for giving scrolling effects just like the original website, it was working very fine and working with jquery is above my expectations.

Talking about the login/signup and “add to cart” page ,I designed the functionality and look of the page with very perfection and completed by using some of the advanced technology like “debounce”, “setInterval” and slick carousel.

I have applied some of the extra things like giving discounts by just entering “MASAI” at the apply coupon part and also debounce functionality on the payment page to give a great user experience.

Talking about the product pages,I have created and designed various product pages for which i prefer to use ES-6 technologies and syntax and I also provided features to add to the cart and also provided the search functionality,filter functionality and sorting fuctionality too.

At the end, I have created the blog page and the footer page.

Overall this is the awesome week which revises my learnings as well as boost my knowledge and lift up my confidence and somewhat ready for the software professional world.
